Proposed Class: CharSetStringProcessor
Status: FAILED_SEMANTIC
Members:
  - containsAny(String,String) (method)
  - count(String,String) (method)
  - deepEmpty(String) (method)
  - delete(String,String) (method)
  - keep(String,String) (method)
  - modify(String,String,boolean) (method)
  - squeeze(String,String) (method)
  - CharSetUtils() (method)

Rationale:
Extracting these methods into CharSetStringProcessor improves adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle by creating a focused class dedicated solely to string manipulation operations based on character sets, rather than mixing these operations with other utility functions. This extraction enhances cohesion by grouping related string processing methods that all share the common pattern of using CharSet instances to filter, count, or modify characters in strings. The separation also improves maintainability and testability by isolating character set-based string operations into a dedicated component with clear boundaries and responsibilities.
